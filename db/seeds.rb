route = Route.create!(user: user, name: "South Downs Way", description: "This undulating route follows footpaths and bridleways. It is the perfect way to explore the chalk downland countryside, and coastline, of the South Downs National Park. Despite its proximity to London and Brighton the South Downs National Park feels a million miles away from modern hubbub. Leave it behind as you follow the route onto the ridgeline, and enjoy the spectacular views. If you get a clear evening, head out to a section of the trail at night for some of the best star gazing opportunities England offers.")
